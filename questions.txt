16. Name something you like about Prolog. Explain.

  I really enjoyed that the language itself is very simplistic to get running and get a program working that you can query on.
  It was a very nice change of pace from the other labs that we had over the semester and I felt like it was a really good "cool down" at the end of an intense semester.

17.Name something you dislike about Prolog. Explain.

  I actually disliked the :- at the end of the first line of a rule definition. It was a very awkward key stroke for me and its actually the only real complaint about Prolog that I have.

18.Did you enjoy this lab? Which aspects did you like and/or dislike?

  I did really enjoy this lab. Like I said in number 16, I really enjoyed that this lab was much simpler than the previous labs.
  I really didn't dislike any aspect of this lab.

19.Approximately how many hours did you spend on this lab?

  I spent about 4 hours on the lab.

20.Do you think you will use Prolog again? For which type(s) of project(s)?

  I personally don't foresee myself using Prolog again in the future unless I want to model a database and I don't want to use MySQL.
